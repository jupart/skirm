== Basics ==
 * Type of project - multiphase design
 * Working title - Aok
 * One line description -

== Gameplay ==
 * Area discovery or limitations
 * Different ways of presenting gameplay
 * Time-based effects per level
 * How to leave level
 * Number of enemies/fight style
 * If you die, you must start over, no saving mid-run

== Plot ==
 * What are you?

     * Aok tribe
     * Sentient machines
     * Bots
     * Humans
 * How are you different?
 * What is your goal?
     * Descend to the core of the planet
 * Who plots against you?
 * What information is revealed?

== Presentation ==
 * Hand drawn art style
 * Main goal is immersion
 * UI is minimal
 * Damage is not shown, so other immediate feedback is necessary
     * Blood, parts flying, sounds
 * Dialogue in speech bubbles

== Mechanics ==
 * Collecting soul from defeated enemies
 * Spend your level up points on elevator ride
 * Four main upgradable abilities per character
 * Pull chunk of rock out of ceiling, floor, or wall
 * Aimable ranged attacks
 * Upgradable items in fixed number of slots, able to spend soul on

== Progression ==
 * Mid-run progression
     * Spend points on abilities and items in elevator ala Dead Space

         * Logs will be short cut scenes, which will unlock new character ability progressions
         * Achievables unlock item info and new item progressions

= Phase 1 =
 * choose smallest number of requirements to get a working prototype
