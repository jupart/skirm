Maps serve as playable levels in Skirm. This file serves as documentation of
what is expected in a map file.

* Maps should have all related files stored in "./resources/maps/map-name" directory
* Should be named "../map-name/0.txt", "../map-name/1.txt", etc. for each z-level
* There must always be a "0.txt", representing the bottom z-level

Valid tiles:
* Wall - '#'
* Ground - '.'
* Empty - ' '
